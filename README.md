_Co-authored by [Juliette](https://github.com/julietteorpen), [Milly](https://github.com/millipede-cpu), [Orian](https://github.com/OrianP) and [Miah](https://github.com/miahbates)._

## What is Lusan?
An e-commerce style site to streamline buying seeds by signposting and comparing seed providers.

## What did we build?
We focused on building the front-end of the site as the data is being prepared. We used next.js so the next development team will be able to incorporate a back-end.

## Tech stack 💻
* Next.js
* React
* Styled-components
* Chance (to generate dummy data)
* React-responsive-carousel
* Cypress
* Vercel deployment

## Team members 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- Miah- Scrum Facilitator.
- Milly - DevOps.
- Orian - Quality Assurance.
- Juliette - User Experience.

## How to install 🛠️
- Git clone `https://github.com/fac-23/lusan-tfb`
- Run command `npm install` in terminal.
- Start sever run command `npm run dev`.
- Run cypress testing run command `npm run test`.

## User Stories :busts_in_silhouette:
- As a user I want to filter search results.
- As a user I want to search seeds.
- As a user I want to view my wishlist.
- As a user I want to add products to my wishlist.
- As a user I want to compare the same products from different providers.

## Features 🌟
* Filtering: filter by catgergory, condition, price.
* Search bar.
* Grid gallery.
* Image carousel.
* Provider comparison table.
* Responsive mobile first design.
* Add and delete from wishlist.
* About us and contact us pages.
* Burger menu.

## Challenges 🏋️‍♀️
* Building a front end only application with next.js to allow for a database to be implemented later.
* Managing a merger conflict with a conflicting package lock.
* Using react components with next.js, using the document to manage server side rendering.
* Generating dummy data in a timely manner.
* Managing shared state amongst several react compnents/pages, this was fixed by using context.
* Creating dynamic routes with appropriate content.

## Learning 🌱
* Understanding of state management, using context to share state between next.js pages.
* Communication with product owner.
* Project scoping.
* Use of local storage.
* Next.js useRouter and understanding of dynamic routes.
* Chance library to generate dummy data.
* Incorporating npm libraries into project.

## Future ideas 🔮
These were out of the scope of this project but with more time we would have implemented the following.
* Move filters to a left sidebar on desktop view.
* Attach database.
* Transform wishlist into a shopping cart.
* User authentication.
